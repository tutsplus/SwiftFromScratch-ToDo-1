### Envato Tuts+ Tutorial: Swift From Scratch: Inheritance and Protocols

#### Instructor: Bart Jacobs

While playgrounds are a great tool to play with Swift and learn the language, it's time to move on and create our first Swift project in Xcode. In this lesson, we're going to create the foundation of a simple to-do application using Xcode and Swift. Along the way, we'll learn more about object-oriented programming and we'll also take a closer look at the integration of Swift and Objective-C.
